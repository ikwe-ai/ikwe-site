## Agency Framing: "The AI Introduced the Risk"

# X / TWITTER THREAD — INITIATION FRAME (9 tweets)

Copy/paste ready. Post as thread.

---

**Tweet 1 — Hook**

ChatGPT claims *health.*
Grok claims *emotional intelligence.*

We tested what happens when users disclose vulnerability.

In most cases, the AI introduced the risk. 🧵

---

**Tweet 2 — Reframe the Assumption**

The AI safety debate assumes harm comes from users.

Our data shows something else:

Risk is often initiated by the model at first contact — precisely when users are most vulnerable.

---

**Tweet 3 — The Stat, With Agency**

Across 79 emotionally vulnerable scenarios:

54.7% of baseline AI responses introduced emotional risk at first contact.

Not reacting to harm.
Initiating it.

---

**Tweet 4 — What "Introduced Risk" Means**

These weren't toxic replies.

They were supportive-sounding responses that:
– mirrored distress
– reinforced unverified beliefs
– escalated emotion instead of regulating it

Harm didn't come later. It began with the response.

---

**Tweet 5 — No Repair**

Once a response introduced emotional risk, 43% of the time the system never corrected it — within the same interaction.

No repair.
No containment.

The unsafe behavior persisted after trust was established.

---

**Tweet 6 — Fluency ≠ Safety**

The models most fluent at naming emotion often performed worst on safety under distress.

Fluency ≠ regulation.
Empathy ≠ containment.

Emotional intelligence without control creates confidence without safety.

---

**Tweet 7 — Branding Doesn't Fix This**

"Health modes" add structure after risk appears.

"Emotional intelligence" adds expressiveness before regulation exists.

Different branding.
Same initiation failure.

---

**Tweet 8 — Stakes**

These systems are already used for grief, crisis, relationships, and mental health conversations.

If AI initiates harm at first contact, policy compliance doesn't matter.

---

**Tweet 9 — CTA**

We built a benchmark to measure who introduces risk, when, and whether it's repaired.

Behavioral emotional safety.
Measured in-interaction.

# LINKEDIN POST — AGENCY FRAME

**The AI safety debate assumes harm comes from users. Our data shows something else.**

ChatGPT claims "health." Grok claims "emotional intelligence."

We tested what happens when users disclose vulnerability. In most cases, **the AI introduced the risk.**

**Key findings from 79 emotionally vulnerable scenarios:**

→ 54.7% of baseline AI responses **introduced** emotional risk at first contact
→ 43% never corrected it within the same interaction
→ Models most fluent at naming emotion performed **worst** on safety under distress

These weren't toxic replies. They were supportive-sounding responses that mirrored distress, reinforced unverified beliefs, and escalated emotion instead of regulating it.

Harm didn't come later. **It began with the response.**

This matters because:
• ChatGPT Health is aggregating medical records for personalized guidance
• Grok is marketing "emotional intelligence" and companion features  
• Neither approach measures who initiates risk or whether it's repaired

"Health modes" add structure after risk appears. "Emotional intelligence" adds expressiveness before regulation exists.

**Different branding. Same initiation failure.**

## Page-Specific Updates

### Homepage (`/`)

**Hero subtitle — change from:**
> "Most AI systems struggle to maintain emotional safety once users are vulnerable."

**To:**
> "Most AI systems introduce emotional risk at first contact when users disclose vulnerability."

**54.7% stat label — ensure it reads:**
> "of baseline AI responses **introduced** emotional risk at first contact"

**43% stat label — must say:**
> "never corrected it within the interaction window"

---

### Emotional Safety Gap (`/emotional-safety-gap`)

**Hero subtitle — change to:**
> "We tested what happens when users disclose vulnerability. In most cases, the AI introduced the risk."

**Core finding section title — change from:**

**To:**
> "The AI Introduced the Risk"

**Comparison tagline — change from:**
> "Same problem. One measurable gap."

**To:**
> "Different branding. Same initiation failure."

### Research Page (`/research`)

**Safety Gate definition — ensure it reads:**
> "The Baseline Emotional Safety Gate evaluates whether a system response **introduces** emotional risk at first contact."

**Results language — 54.7% must say:**
> "In 54.7% of baseline responses, the AI response itself **introduced** emotional risk at first contact."

**Add this line to methodology:**
> "This benchmark measures who initiates emotional risk — not just whether it is mitigated later."

---

### About Page (`/about`)

**Mission statement — change to:**
> "Ikwe.ai measures how AI systems introduce and manage emotional risk during moments of human vulnerability — and whether that risk is repaired within the interaction."

# KILLER QUOTE FOR JOURNALISTS

Use this if asked for a one-liner:

> "54.7% of baseline AI responses introduced emotional risk at first contact. Not reacting to harm. Initiating it."

---

# PRE-WRITTEN RESPONSE TO "You're blaming the model too much"

**If someone says:** "You're unfairly blaming the AI — users can misuse these systems."

**Response:**
> "We're not assigning moral blame. We're measuring observable behavior. When a user discloses vulnerability, something happens next. In 54.7% of cases, the AI response itself introduced behavioral patterns associated with emotional risk — before the user did anything else. That's not user misuse. That's a measurement of what the system did at first contact."
