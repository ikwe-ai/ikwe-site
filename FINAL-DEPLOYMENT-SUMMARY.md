- ✅ If visitor asks "which one is for me?" → page is clear

4. **Friction reducer:** "No long-term commitment required to start"

### Partner Page
5. **Reduce noise:** Clear "what this is NOT" section
6. **Selective positioning:** "reviewed for strategic fit"
7. **After purchase:** "typically begin after an audit"
