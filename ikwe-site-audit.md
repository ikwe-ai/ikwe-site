# Ikwe.ai Site Audit: Current vs Target Messaging

**Date:** February 4, 2026
**Purpose:** Prepare ikwe.ai for investor meetings next week with crystal-clear value proposition

---

## Executive Summary

**Current State:** Research-forward, systems-heavy, impressive but not instantly clear
**Target State:** Value-forward, outcome-focused, immediately understandable

**Core Issue:** The site currently explains *what Ikwe measures* instead of *why early visibility matters*.

---

## 🔴 Critical Changes Needed

### 1. HERO SECTION (Above the Fold)

#### ❌ Current:
```
Title: "Human trust is the real risk in AI."
Subtitle: "Ikwe.ai measures where AI systems break human judgment — before those failures scale into crisis."
```

**Problems:**
- Leads with the problem, not the solution
- "Measures" is passive—doesn't show value
- No mention of timing advantage
- Doesn't answer: "What do you DO for me?"

#### ✅ Target (from handoff doc):
```
Headline: "Ikwe helps AI teams identify harm and risk patterns early enough to change outcomes."

Subhead: "Most AI harm is detectable before escalation—but current safety approaches surface risk too late."
```

**Why this works:**
- Leads with outcome ("change outcomes")
- Establishes timing advantage immediately
- Clear who it's for ("AI teams")
- Simple, confident, no jargon

---

### 2. RESULTS CARD (Right side of hero)

#### ❌ Current:
```
"EQ Safety Benchmark · Key Finding"
"54.7% of AI responses passed the emotional safety gate"
"Two-stage framework: Stage 1... Stage 2..."
"Ikwe EI Prototype: 84.6% conditional performance"
```

**Problems:**
- Leads with technical framework names
- Uses research terminology ("EQ Safety Benchmark", "conditional performance")
- Visitor thinks: "Interesting research" not "I need this"
- Too much cognitive load for first 10 seconds

#### ✅ Target:
Remove this card entirely OR replace with simple proof:
```
"What Ikwe's work shows:
• Risk signals appear earlier at the trajectory level
• These patterns repeat across cases
• Standard checks don't surface them
• Earlier visibility changes decisions"
```

---

### 3. THESIS SECTION

#### ❌ Current:
```
"Accuracy explains models. It doesn't protect people."
```

**Problems:**
- This is about the problem space
- Defensive positioning
- Doesn't connect to Ikwe's value

#### ✅ Target (from handoff doc):
```
"The failure mode in AI safety is timing, not intent."

Ikwe exists to make early signals visible and actionable.
```

**Why this works:**
- Frames the insight positively
- Connects directly to Ikwe's value (timing)
- No defense, just clarity

---

### 4. WHAT WE PROVIDE SECTION

#### ❌ Current:
```
"Enterprise evaluation of human-trust risk in AI systems"

Three cards:
• "Human trust & risk evaluations"
• "Failure modes accuracy misses"
• "Enterprise-ready reporting"
```

**Problems:**
- Still describing process, not value
- "Evaluation" is vague
- Doesn't connect to outcomes

#### ✅ Target:
Reframe as **Problem → Proof → Offer**

**Problem:**
- Harm emerges across interaction trajectories
- Single-output safety misses escalation
- The issue isn't intent—it's timing

**Proof:**
- Risk signals appear earlier at trajectory level
- These patterns repeat across cases
- Standard checks don't surface them
- Earlier visibility changes decisions

**Offer:**
- Risk & Harm Pattern Audit
- Early signal visibility
- Earlier intervention windows

---

### 5. OFFERINGS SECTION

#### ❌ Current:
```
"How engagement works"
Three cards:
• Step 1: Scoped Pilot (60-90 days)
• Step 2: Evaluation & Benchmarking
• Step 3: Risk & Trust Report
```

**Problems:**
- Too much process detail too early
- Creates decision fatigue
- Sounds like consulting, not product

#### ✅ Target:
Single clear offer:

```
"How teams work with Ikwe"

Risk & Harm Pattern Audit

What it is:
Analysis of interaction trajectories to surface early harm and risk signals current monitoring misses.

What teams get:
• A clear map of where risk forms and escalates
• Visibility into early signals before incidents
• Actionable insight for earlier intervention

Engagement types: Pilot | Audit | Advisory
```

## 🟢 What's Working (Keep These)

1. **Clean Design:** Professional, modern, accessible
2. **Visual Hierarchy:** Good use of spacing and sections
3. **Navigation:** Well-organized, logical structure
4. **CTA Placement:** Buttons are clear and well-positioned
5. **Footer:** Comprehensive, includes all necessary links
6. **Mobile Responsive:** Layout adapts well

---

## 📋 Explicit "Do Not Lead With" Items

Per handoff doc, these should NOT be in hero or first sections:

- ❌ "EQ Safety Benchmark"
- ❌ "Two-stage framework"
- ❌ "Emotional safety gate"
- ❌ "Behavioral emotional safety"
- ❌ "Stage 1 / Stage 2" explanations
- ❌ Specific percentages and research findings
- ❌ Technical methodology details
- ❌ Systems architecture language
- ❌ Personal story or narrative defense

**These belong in:**
- Research pages
- Methodology section
- Blog posts
- Deep-dive content
- Follow-up conversations

---

## 🎯 The One-Sentence Anchor (Use Everywhere)

**From handoff doc:**
> "Ikwe doesn't predict outcomes. Ikwe changes when teams see risk—and timing changes outcomes."

This should guide every messaging decision.

## 📐 New Site Structure (Approved)

### Above the Fold
- **Headline:** Ikwe helps AI teams identify harm and risk patterns early enough to change outcomes.
- **Subhead:** Most AI harm is detectable before escalation—but current safety approaches surface risk too late.
- **CTA:** "Request a risk audit" or "Start a pilot"

### Problem Section
- Harm emerges across interaction trajectories
- Single-output safety misses escalation
- The issue isn't intent—it's timing

### Proof Section
What Ikwe's work shows:
- Risk signals appear earlier at the trajectory level
- These patterns repeat across cases
- Standard checks don't surface them
- Earlier visibility changes decisions

### Offer Section
**Risk & Harm Pattern Audit**
- What it is
- What teams get
- How to start

### Social Proof / Who Uses This
- AI product teams
- Trust & Safety leaders
- Regulated industries
- Anyone deploying AI in high-stakes contexts

### CTA
- One clear action
- Remove friction

---

## 🚀 Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Hero (Do First - Highest ROI)
1. Rewrite hero headline and subhead
2. Replace or remove stats card
3. Simplify CTAs to one primary action

### Phase 2: Core Sections (Do Second)
1. Rewrite thesis section
2. Restructure "What We Provide" to Problem → Proof → Offer
3. Simplify offerings to single clear audit offer

### Phase 3: Polish (Do Third)
1. Update navigation if needed
2. Ensure all CTAs lead to same place
3. Remove research jargon from all above-fold content

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

After changes, a cold visitor should be able to answer these in 60 seconds:

1. **What does Ikwe do?** ➔ Identifies harm/risk patterns early
2. **Why does that matter?** ➔ Early enough to change outcomes
3. **Who is this for?** ➔ AI teams deploying systems
4. **What do I get?** ➔ Risk & Harm Pattern Audit
5. **What's the proof?** ➔ Early signals appear before incidents

If they can't answer these, the messaging isn't clear enough.

## 📝 Handoff Protection

**Core value prop (LOCKED):**
> "Ikwe helps AI teams identify harm and risk patterns early enough to change outcomes."

**Guiding principle for all edits:**
> If content feels impressive but unclear → cut
> If content feels accurate but dense → simplify
> If content feels true but defensive → remove

**The strength is clarity under complexity. The site must model that.**

---

## Next Steps

1. Review this audit
2. Approve direction
3. Implement Phase 1 (hero rewrite)
4. Test with fresh eyes
5. Iterate based on feedback
6. Deploy before investor meetings

**Remember:** Clarity equals capital. Every word should earn its place by making the value clearer, not by being impressive.
