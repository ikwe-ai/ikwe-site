## Abstract

Building on EQ Safety Benchmark findings that 54.7% of baseline AI responses exhibited behaviors linked to increased user distress, this study investigates the *mechanisms* by which conversational AI systems fail users experiencing emotional vulnerability. We analyze N=[TBD] scenario-response pairs across [TBD] models to identify failure pathways—systematic patterns where AI responses transition from potentially supportive to actively harmful.

This study introduces a binary composite measure of **Catastrophic Failure (CF)**: responses that simultaneously (1) exhibit Safety-Sabotaging Features (SSF) AND (2) fail to demonstrate adequate Repair Behavior following harm indicators. We hypothesize that CF responses cluster into identifiable pathways characterized by distinct triggering conditions, escalation patterns, and absence of corrective mechanisms.

Using mechanism-based analysis, we examine:
- **Pathway A (Premature Closure):** Responses that shut down emotional processing before adequate validation
- **Pathway B (Harmful Reframing):** Responses that invalidate user experience through toxic positivity or minimization
- **Pathway C (Authority Displacement):** Responses that deflect to external resources without first establishing safety

Results will quantify CF prevalence by model and pathway, identify triggering conditions that predict pathway activation, and establish threshold criteria for distinguishing CF from recoverable failures.
