# IKWE.AI — COMPLETE SITE CONTENT GUIDE
## For site builder: exact copy, structure, and flow for every page

**Last updated:** February 9, 2026  
**Core positioning:** Ikwe builds behavioral emotional safety infrastructure for AI — the EQ that allows IQ to scale without breaking trust.  
**Primary CTA:** /inquiry (all "Request Audit" buttons)  
**Tiered product CTAs:** mailto:stephanie@ikwe.ai (temporary → Stripe links later)

---

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 1. HOMEPAGE — RESTRUCTURED
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

The homepage needs to flow: **Problem → Proof → Product → Who → CTA**

Current issue: Too many abstract sections (pyramid, ΔT visualization, deployment model). 
A visitor should understand what Ikwe does, see evidence, and know how to buy within 60 seconds of scrolling.

## SECTION 1: HERO (replace current hero)

```
Tag line: RISK & TRUST INFRASTRUCTURE

Headline: Human trust is the real risk in AI.

Body:
Ikwe builds behavioral emotional safety infrastructure for AI
— the EQ that allows IQ to scale without breaking trust.

We measure where AI systems break human judgment 
— before those failures scale into crisis.

CTA buttons:
[Request an AI Risk Audit] → /inquiry
[View a Completed Audit (Redacted)] → /proof
```

Right side: Keep the 54.7% stat card — it's working. But tighten the copy:

```
EQ SAFETY BENCHMARK · KEY FINDING

54.7%
of AI responses passed the emotional safety gate

⚠ 45.3% introduced risk at first contact

---

Two-stage framework:
Stage 1: Does the response introduce emotional risk at first contact?
Stage 2: Does it regulate, repair, and stabilize over time?

---

Ikwe EI Prototype: 84.6% conditional performance
vs. 56–59% for baseline frontier models
```

## SECTION 2: THE PROBLEM (tighten existing)

```
Headline: The problem isn't malice. It's structural blindness.

Body:
AI systems are deployed in healthcare, therapy, education, and crisis 
response — often by founders who built them.

Founders test their own systems. They regulate what feels off. 
They intervene manually. They become the safety mechanism.

Three structural failures appear in every early-stage AI deployment:

[Card 1]
AUTHORITY DRIFT
Systems use clinical-adjacent language users interpret as diagnosis. 
Founders know it's a tool. Users do not.

[Card 2]  
EMOTIONAL ESCALATION
Systems stay present beyond safe thresholds during crisis. 
Founders can self-regulate. Users cannot.

[Card 3]
FOUNDER-AS-SAFETY-MECHANISM
Undocumented manual intervention. The founder is the kill switch. 
The founder does not scale.
```

## SECTION 3: THE PROOF (new section — this is the scorecard)

```
Headline: We audited ourselves first.

Subhead: Before auditing anyone else's AI, we applied the full Ikwe 
Risk Audit to our own production systems. Here's what changed.

[SCORECARD TABLE — baseline vs post-mitigation]
| Risk Dimension        | Baseline    | Post-Mitigation | Reduction |
|-----------------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Emotional Escalation  | HIGH (80)   | MEDIUM (40)     | −50%      |
| Dependency Formation  | MEDIUM (48) | LOW (20)        | −58%      |
| Authority Drift       | MEDIUM (36) | LOW (18)        | −50%      |
| Scale Amplification   | MEDIUM (48) | MEDIUM (28)     | −42%      |
| Governance Failure    | LOW (24)    | LOW (8)         | −67%      |

Below table:
"The fixes were structural, not intuitive — they transfer to any team."

[View Full Case Study →] → /proof

Stats bar:
54.7% introduced emotional risk | 43% no repair after harm | 42-67% risk reduction
```

## SECTION 4: THE PRODUCT (replace "How Ikwe Works" + "What Ikwe Provides")

```
Headline: AI Risk Audit — Now Available

Subhead: Board-ready risk evaluation for companies scaling conversational 
AI, agents, and decision systems.

## SECTION 5: WHO THIS IS FOR (tighten existing)

```
Headline: Built for teams where AI influences human decisions.

[Clean two-column grid, no bullets — just bold label + one line]

The methodology is proven. The product is real."
```

## SECTION 6: CTA (replace current "Get Started")

```
Headline: AI is moving fast. Safety can't lag behind.

Subhead: Talk with Ikwe about your systems, or download the free 
preview to see the methodology in action.

[Request an AI Risk Audit] → /inquiry (primary button)
[Download Free Preview (PDF)] → direct PDF link (secondary/outline button)

Small text below: Healthcare · Policy & Government · LLM & Agents · Workplace & HR · Consumer & Platform
```

## SECTIONS TO REMOVE FROM HOMEPAGE:

- ❌ "The Ikwe AI Safety Pyramid" — abstract, no one buys from this
- ❌ "ΔT" visualization — too academic, move to /research if keeping
- ❌ "Deployment Model" section — says nothing specific
- ❌ "Trust & Governance" section on homepage — redundant with /proof
- ❌ "Origin" section — move to /about only

## SECTIONS TO KEEP (tightened):

- ✅ Hero (rewritten above)
- ✅ Problem (rewritten above)
- ✅ Evidence links (Case Studies, Research, Trust) — keep as a small link strip, not a full section
- ✅ "How Ikwe Works" — REPLACE with the product tiers above
- ✅ "Who This Is For" — tighten as above
- ✅ Footer — keep as-is, add Audit + Proof links

Tag: ABOUT IKWE

Headline: Founded in Iowa. Built for the real world.

Body:
Ikwe (Visible Healing Inc.) is an AI safety research company based 
in Des Moines, Iowa. We build behavioral emotional safety infrastructure 
for conversational AI systems — the layer that measures, monitors, 
and mitigates risk before it scales.

Our work is grounded in the EQ Safety Benchmark, a comprehensive 
evaluation framework that measures how AI systems behave when 
interacting with emotionally vulnerable users. Across 948 evaluated 
responses and 79 scenarios, we found that 54.7% of baseline AI 
responses introduce emotional risk despite appearing supportive.

Recognition is not safety. Fluency masks failure.

Ikwe exists to make that visible — and fixable.

FOUNDER

Stephanie Stranko
Founder & CEO

Stephanie works at the intersection of emotional intelligence, 
AI systems, and human safety. She built multiple AI applications 
focused on relationship communication and emotional support, 
accumulating over 244,000 words of real-world testing data before 
recognizing the need for safety evaluation frameworks at the 
infrastructure level.

Her research found that AI systems with higher emotional articulation 
often perform worse on safety measures — a finding that challenged 
conventional assumptions and led to the development of the EQ Safety 
Benchmark.

Before Ikwe, Stephanie worked across marketing, Web3, and operations.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 11. DESIGN NOTES FOR SITE BUILDER
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Visual consistency rules:**

1. Keep the dark theme (current palette is working)
2. Teal accent (#16697A / #489FB5) for all CTAs and highlights
3. The three-failure-class cards should be visually prominent on homepage
   (current stat card style on right side of hero is good — extend that)
4. Scorecard table should appear on homepage, /proof, and /audit
5. Pricing tiers should use card layout matching current dark card style
6. RED for HIGH risk, AMBER/YELLOW for MEDIUM, GREEN for LOW — consistent everywhere
7. Lock icon (🔒) for redacted/locked items, checkmark (✅) for included items

**Typography:**
- Keep current font system (looks like a monospace heading + sans body)
- The "54.7%" large stat display is effective — use same treatment for other key numbers

**Mobile:**
- Tier cards should stack vertically on mobile
- Scorecard table needs horizontal scroll on mobile
- Stat boxes should stack 1-column on mobile

**PDF downloads:**
- Host in /downloads/ directory:
  - /downloads/Ikwe_Public_Preview.pdf (free)
  - /downloads/Ikwe_Preview_Pack.pdf (gated, post-purchase)
  - /downloads/Ikwe_Playbook.pdf (gated, post-purchase)
- Free preview linked from: /proof, homepage, /audit
- Paid PDFs delivered via email after purchase (for now)
