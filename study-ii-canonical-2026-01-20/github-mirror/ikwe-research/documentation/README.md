## Study II: Mechanism-Based Analysis of Catastrophic Failure

### Overview

Building on EQ Safety Benchmark findings (54.7% of baseline AI responses exhibited behaviors linked to increased user distress), Study II investigates the *mechanisms* by which conversational AI systems fail users experiencing emotional vulnerability.

### Key Contributions

1. **Catastrophic Failure (CF) Definition** — Binary composite measure identifying responses that cause harm AND fail to repair
2. **Failure Pathway Taxonomy** — Classification of CF into Premature Closure, Harmful Reframing, and Authority Displacement
3. **Scoring Infrastructure** — Reproducible codebook and spreadsheet system for CF assessment

### Current Status

| Component | Version | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Research Framework | v1.0 | 🔒 LOCKED |
| Scoring Tools | v1.0 | 🔒 LOCKED |
| Data Collection | — | Not Started |

## Version Control Policy

### Locked Documents

Documents marked `LOCKED` cannot be edited during data collection. Changes require:

1. Version increment (v1.0 → v1.1)
2. Changelog entry documenting change and rationale
3. Assessment of impact on study validity

### Changelog
