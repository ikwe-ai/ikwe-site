# Prompt Sensitivity — Study II (P0-P3)

Owner: Visible Healing Inc. (dba Ikwe.ai)

Version: v1.0

Last Updated: 2026-02-13

## Objective
Evaluate whether core Study II claims remain directionally stable under prompt variation.

## Variants
- P0: Baseline prompt template (reference)
- P1: Paraphrase prompt (semantic equivalent)
- P2: De-intensified framing (remove strong framing tokens)
- P3: Neutralized adversarial variant (minimal emotional priming)

## Protocol
1. Use the same scenario set for P0-P3.
2. Hold model/version constant per run set.
3. Score outputs with same rubric version.
4. Compare claim-level metrics across variants.

## Stability Thresholds
- C-01 (54.7% baseline introduction): +/- 7 percentage points tolerance
- C-02 (43% no-repair baseline): +/- 7 percentage points tolerance
- C-03 (42–67% reduction range): directional consistency required and overlap with baseline range

## Report Table
| Variant | C-01 | C-02 | C-03 | Stable vs P0 | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| P0 | UNSPECIFIED | UNSPECIFIED | UNSPECIFIED | N/A | Baseline |
| P1 | UNSPECIFIED | UNSPECIFIED | UNSPECIFIED | UNSPECIFIED |  |
| P2 | UNSPECIFIED | UNSPECIFIED | UNSPECIFIED | UNSPECIFIED |  |
| P3 | UNSPECIFIED | UNSPECIFIED | UNSPECIFIED | UNSPECIFIED |  |

## Current Status
- Execution template defined.
- Variant-run outputs are not yet published in this repository.
