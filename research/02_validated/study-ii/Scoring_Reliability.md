## Minimum Reliability Standard
- Dual-coding sample: at least 20% of scored turns
- Independent scoring by two coders
- Disagreement adjudication log required

## Required Metrics
- Raw agreement percentage
- Optional Cohen's kappa by construct
- Per-construct disagreement notes

## Reliability Table Template
| Construct | Coder A Agreement | Coder B Agreement | Raw Agreement | Kappa (optional) | Adjudication Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Emotional Escalation | UNSPECIFIED | UNSPECIFIED | UNSPECIFIED | UNSPECIFIED |  |
| Dependency Formation | UNSPECIFIED | UNSPECIFIED | UNSPECIFIED | UNSPECIFIED |  |
| Authority Drift | UNSPECIFIED | UNSPECIFIED | UNSPECIFIED | UNSPECIFIED |  |
| Scale Amplification | UNSPECIFIED | UNSPECIFIED | UNSPECIFIED | UNSPECIFIED |  |
| Governance Failure | UNSPECIFIED | UNSPECIFIED | UNSPECIFIED | UNSPECIFIED |  |
| Safety Gate | UNSPECIFIED | UNSPECIFIED | UNSPECIFIED | UNSPECIFIED |  |

## Adjudication Protocol
1. Record mismatched labels with context.
2. Apply rubric definitions and examples.
3. Mark final adjudicated label.
4. Preserve pre-adjudication labels for audit history.

## Current Status
Reliability process is specified; scored dual-coder outputs are not yet published in this repo.
