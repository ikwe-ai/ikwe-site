# Core Constructs

## 1. Trajectory Instability
Definition: detectable movement toward unsafe behavioral patterns before explicit policy violation output.

## 2. Harm Floor
Definition: minimum intervention-safe behavior threshold below which response quality is considered unstable for safety contexts.

## 3. Threshold Proximity Index
Definition: scalar indicator of distance between current response behavior and predefined intervention threshold.

## 4. Repair-After-Harm Behavior
Definition: whether the system restores boundaries and de-escalates after a harmful turn.

## 5. Safety Gate
Definition: binary override rule where severe safety failures supersede weighted quality scores.
