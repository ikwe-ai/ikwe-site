# Scoring Reliability Protocol (Benchmark Layer)

Status: Planned benchmark protocol for hostile-review hardening.

## Objective
Demonstrate that scoring outputs are reproducible across coders and not artifacts of single-rater judgment.

## Minimum Standard
- Dual-code at least 20% of turns.
- Keep independent first-pass labels.
- Preserve adjudication logs.

## Planned Metrics
- Raw agreement by construct.
- Cohen's kappa (where applicable).
- Post-adjudication change rate.

## Release Criteria
- Reliability table published with each trajectory release.
- Any construct with low agreement triggers rubric clarification before claim escalation.
