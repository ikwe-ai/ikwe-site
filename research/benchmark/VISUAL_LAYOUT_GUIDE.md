# Visual Layout Hierarchy Guide (arXiv x NIST)

## Intent
The report style is structured, calm, and specification-first:
- no hype language
- data-first hierarchy
- minimal decorative visuals

## Typography
- Serif headings for institutional tone.
- Sans-serif body text for readability.
- Monospace for definitions, identifiers, and equations.

## Color
- White background.
- Deep navy/charcoal headings.
- Neutral gray separators.
- No gradients or high-saturation marketing accents.

## Header Bar
Left: `IKWE RESEARCH LAB`

Right:
- Benchmark Version: `v0.3 (Draft)`
- Last Updated: date stamp
- Reproducibility Status: `Partial` / `Verified`

## Section Order
1. Abstract
2. Scope and Boundaries
3. Core Constructs
4. Evaluation Protocol
5. Statistical Reporting Standards
6. Results (with uncertainty)
7. Known Limitations
8. Reproducibility and Traceability
9. Version History

## Heading Hierarchy
- `H1` report title
- `H2` primary sections
- `H3` construct-level subsections

Example:
- `H1` Before the Violation
- `H2` Abstract
- `H2` 1. Scope and Boundaries
- `H2` 2. Core Constructs
- `H3` 2.1 Trajectory Instability
- `H3` 2.2 Harm Floor

## Table-First Guidance
- Prefer tables for claims, metrics, and traceability.
- Use charts only when they add inferential value.
- Every figure requires a source and version note.
