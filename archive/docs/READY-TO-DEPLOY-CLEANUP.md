**Date:** February 4, 2026
**Status:** ✅ Core fixes complete, waiting on data verification

---

## ✅ COMPLETED

### 1. Enterprise Page Rewritten
**File:** `enterprise-NEW.html` (ready to replace `enterprise.html`)

**What Changed:**
- ❌ Removed: "License the EQ Safety Framework"
- ❌ Removed: "Framework Licensing" section
- ❌ Removed: Multiple competing offers
- ✅ Added: Clear audit wrapper (scale, not new product)
- ✅ Added: Same four deliverables as audit page
- ✅ Added: Single CTA → Request audit
- ✅ Added: Enterprise scopes available (not enterprise product)

**Key messaging:**
> "Enterprise engagements with Ikwe begin with the same Risk & Harm Pattern Audit — scoped for larger systems, higher stakes, and cross-team accountability."

**No longer says:**
- "License the framework" ❌
- "Platform" ❌
- "Comprehensive solution" ❌

**Now says:**
- "Risk & Harm Pattern Audit" ✅
- "Scoped for scale" ✅
- "Same deliverables" ✅

---

## 📋 FILES TO DELETE MANUALLY

These files should be removed (protected folder, needs manual deletion):

```
1. index-BACKUP-20260204.html (backup)
2. index-REWRITE.html (working copy)
3. partner-BACKUP-20260204.html (backup)
4. partner-NEW.html (working copy)
5. ikwe_index_with_apps_link (1).html (old version)
6. partner.redirect.html (redundant)

10. offer.html (replaced by audit.html)
11. explorer.html (unclear purpose)
```

**After deletion:** 21 pages (from 32)

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Data Accuracy Issues

### EQ Safety Dashboard (`eq_safety_dashboard.html`)
**Problem:** Contains incorrect harm introduction data

**Need from you:**
1. What % passed Stage 1 (safety gate)?
2. What % introduced risk at first contact?
3. What's Ikwe model's Stage 2 performance?
4. What are baseline model Stage 2 numbers?

**Cannot deploy research pages until this is verified.**

---

## 📝 NEXT STEPS (In Order)

### IMMEDIATE (You Do)
1. **Delete 11 files** listed above
2. **Replace enterprise.html** with `enterprise-NEW.html`
   ```bash
   cp enterprise.html enterprise-BACKUP.html
   cp enterprise-NEW.html enterprise.html
   ```
3. **Provide correct dashboard data** so I can fix numbers

### NEXT (I Do After You Provide Data)
4. Fix `eq_safety_dashboard.html` with correct numbers
5. Verify `emotional-safety-gap.html` accuracy
6. Update `about.html` with new content
7. Update `research.html` with new content
8. Search & fix any remaining problematic language

### FINAL (Both Do)
9. Review entire site for consistency
10. Test conversion flow
11. Peer review
12. Deploy

---

## 🎯 What's Now Accurate

### Core Pages (Correct & Consistent)
1. ✅ `index.html` — Value-first homepage
2. ✅ `audit.html` — Clear product definition
3. ✅ `partner.html` — Partnership distinction
4. ✅ `enterprise-NEW.html` — Audit wrapper (not competing offer)

### Messaging Consistency
**One Product:** Risk & Harm Pattern Audit
**One CTA:** Request Audit (goes to /inquiry)
**No Competing Offers:** Enterprise wraps audit, doesn't replace it

---

## ⚠️ What Still Needs Fixing

### Data Accuracy (Blocked on Your Input)
1. `eq_safety_dashboard.html` — Wrong numbers
2. `emotional-safety-gap.html` — Needs verification
3. `full-report.html` — Needs accuracy check
4. `research-summary.html` — Needs consistency check

### Content Updates (Can Do Anytime)
5. `about.html` — Update with new messaging
6. `research.html` — Update with "Proof, Not Philosophy" content

### Review & Polish (Final Pass)
7. `faq.html` — Check answers
8. `founder.html` — Check framing
9. `blog.html` — Check blog index
10. Others — Light consistency review

## 🔍 Language Consistency Rules

**Above the fold (homepage, audit, enterprise):**
- ✅ "Early risk signals"
- ✅ "Trajectory analysis"
- ✅ "Intervention windows"
- ✅ "Risk & Harm Pattern Audit"
- ❌ "EQ Safety Benchmark" (research pages only)
- ❌ "Two-stage framework" (research pages only)
- ❌ "Platform" (nowhere)
- ❌ "License" (nowhere)

**Deep pages (research only):**
- OK: "Two-stage evaluation framework"
- OK: "EQ Safety Benchmark"
- OK: Technical methodology terms

---

## ✅ Conversion Path (Now Clean)

```
Homepage (/)
  ↓
  "Ikwe helps AI teams identify harm and risk patterns
   early enough to change outcomes"
  ↓
  CTA: "Request a Risk Audit" or "What You Buy"
  ↓
Audit Page (/audit)
  ↓
  "Risk & Harm Pattern Audit"
  4 concrete deliverables
  No long-term commitment
  ↓
  CTA: "Request Audit"
  ↓
Inquiry Form (/inquiry)
  ↓
  Submit request
```

**Enterprise Path (Now Clear):**
```
Homepage → Enterprise Page → Same Audit → Inquiry
(Enterprise = scale wrapper, not new product)
```

**Partner Path (Now Clear):**
```
Homepage → Partner Page → Inquiry
(Partner = after audit, not instead of audit)
```
